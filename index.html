                <span>The word "kiwi" often brings to mind the image of something small, brown,
                    fuzzy, and found in the produce section</span> of your local supermarket. But the
                kiwi is not a fruit—that's kiwifruit, which is native to eastern Asia! About the
                size of a chicken, the kiwi is a small, flightless, and nearly wingless bird
                found only in New Zealand.

                            <h4 class="list-title">HABITAT AND DIET</h4>
                            <p>The kiwi lives in forested areas of New Zealand that tend
                                to be very steep and wet, surrounded by shrubs and trees
                                found nowhere else on Earth. Since it is not able to fly up
                                into trees to nest, rest, or escape from danger, the kiwi
                                makes its home in burrows in the ground of its swampy
                                forest or grassland habitat. The bird digs multiple burrows
                                within its territory, using strong toes and claws. Nest
                                burrows, dug early in the season, become overgrown at
                                the entrance to provide great camouflage by the time the
                                female is ready to lay her eggs.</p>

                            <h4 class="list-title">FAMILY LIFE</h4>
                            <P>Kiwi pairs use gentle grunts and snuffles with each other
                                and their chicks, and males purr during mating. Pairs do
                                fight, and the larger female may kick the male away if she
                                is not in the mood for his company. If another kiwi
                                invades a pair’s territory, a kicking fight ensues, and kiwis
                                have been known to fight to the death, although this is
                                rare.</P>

                            <p>An adult male and female kiwi typically pair for life, but a
                                female may choose a new male if a more desirable one
                                wanders by. The male doesn't have beautiful songs or
                                fancy feathers to attract a female. Instead, he follows one
                                around constantly while grunting. If she's not interested,
                                the female might wander off or try to scare him away.
                                Breeding season is late winter to early summer. Nests
                                might be in hollow logs or in underground burrows dug
                                by the male.
                            </p>


                            <p>The female kiwi lays up to six eggs every year. Kiwi eggs
                                are smooth and white, off-white, or pale green in color.
                                They are also huge in comparison to the mother: one egg
                                might reach up to 20 percent of her weight; that would
                                be like a 120-pound (54 kilograms) human female giving
                                birth to a 24-pound (11 kilograms) baby! Compared to
                                the relative weights of other birds and their eggs, the
                                female kiwi should weigh about 31 pounds (14 kilograms)
                                rather than its typical weight of 2 to 8 pounds (0.9 to 3.6
                                kilograms).</p>
